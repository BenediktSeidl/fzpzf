# testserver

if you execute `testserver.py` and surf to `http://localhost:8000/` you will be able to browse the files of the temp folder.

the script monitors python files in the root directory and all files in the packages and parts folder. if one of them is changed, the main script fzpzf.py is executed and the files in the browser will be refreshed.
